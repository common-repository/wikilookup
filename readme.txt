Add the power of Wikipedia to your Blog.

== Description ==
Wikilookup allows you to easily add popups and info cards from Wikipedia (and other wikis) to your posts.

= Features =
* Easily mark words and terms in your posts to pop information from Wikipedia articles
* Easily add a stylized card in your post and pages that displays information from Wikipedia article
* Pull from multiple language Wikipedias and dictate the default language for your blog content
* Pull information from other wikis easily, like specialized wikis and game wikis
* Robust settings allowing you to control the text and general behavior of the popups and cards
* Support displaying content in Right to Left languages

== Usage ==
This plugin offers two pieces: a popup, and a 'card', or a static poster, from Wikipedia or other wikis that operate on MediaWiki software.

= Adding popups =
To add a popup, while editing a post, surround your text with `[wikipopup]` shortcode. You can reference a language or a different source, if you've set one up.

For example:
- `[wikipopup]WordPress[/wikipopup]` - Displays a popup from English Wikipedia about the article "WordPress"
- `[wikipopup title="WordPress"]This is some text[/wikipopup]` - Displays a popup from English Wikipedia about the article "WordPress", while the trigger text is 'This is some text'
- `[wikipopup title="WordPress" source="ext"]This is some text[/wikipopup]` - Displays a popup from the external source you've defined as "ext", about the article "WordPress", while the trigger text is 'This is some text'

You can define sources in "Settings -> Wikilookup -> External wikis".

= Adding cards =
To add a card, while editing a post, add a line with `[wikicard title="term"]`. You can reference a language or a different source, if you've set one up.

For example:
- `[wikicard title="WordPress"]` - Displays a static card from English Wikipedia about the article "WordPress".
- `[wikicard title="WordPress" lang="es"]` - Displays a static card from Spanish Wikipedia about the article "WordPress".
- `[wikicard title="WordPress" source="ext"]` - Displays a static card from the external source you've defined as "ext", about the article "WordPress".

You can define sources in "Settings -> Wikilookup -> External wikis".
